Today, I received the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus award letter](../OS_Peer_Bonus_H2_2021_Cuong_Manh_Le_OSPB_Award_Letter.pdf) for my contribution to The [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

On July, I also got a [gift card from GoogleOSS](https://twitter.com/cuonglm_/status/1416717058142740481?s=20).

I have never ever thought about these when I [started contributing to Go years ago](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/25352/), but it just happens.

Til next time!
